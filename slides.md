## Using Primary and Secondary Sources to Build an Argument


## Today's goals
* Review the basic anatomy of an academic argument
* Use the BEAM method to reflect on the various ways of incorporating sources into an academic argument
* Identify a few examples of the above in Sara Salih's  “The History of Mary Prince, the Black Subject, and the Black Canon"


## Anatomy of academic arguments
* Claim
* Reasons
* Evidence
* Warrant
* Acknowledgement & Response

"In a research argument, you make a _claim_, back it with _reasons_ supported by _evidence_, _acknowledge_ and _respond_ to other views, and sometimes explain your _principles_ of reasoning." (Booth et al. 112)

## Claim
What do you want me to believe?

A good claim should be specific and falsifiable.

### Example
_The Ministry of the Future_ is Kim Stanley Robinson's most mature work of climate science fiction.

## Reasons
Why should I agree?

Reasons are your arguments to support your claim.

### Example
All of Robinson's major climate change themes are on display in _The Ministry of the Future_.

## Evidence
How do you know?

Readers will not accept a reason unless it is based on what _they_ accept as concrete evidence.

### Example
Passages from _The Ministry of the Future_ demonstrating Robinson's most important climate change themes.

## In sum (so far):
CLAIM because of REASON based on EVIDENCE

## Warrant
How does that follow?

Warrants connect reasons to your claim. Sometimes they may remain implicit, but they may need to be made explicit.

### Example
A fully mature work will incorporate previously developed themes and ideas.

## Acknowledgement & Response
But what about...?

A convincing argument will address reasonable objections.

### Example
Although some other important themes from Robinson's previous work, such as gender and animality, are not present in _The Ministry_, these themes are not relevant to his views of climate change.


## How do primary and secondary sources fit into the anatomy of an argument?

## BEAM Method
* The BEAM method identifies sources by the functional role they play in an argument.

## Background
* Background sources are used for factual knowledge and/or common knowledge.
* A background source may be used to inform or contextualize your _claim_.

## Exhibit
* Exhibit sources are used for explication, analysis or interpretation.
* An exhibit sources may be used as _evidence_ supporting your _reasons_.

## Argument
* Argument sources are materials an author affirms, disputes, refines, or extends.
* An argument source may be used to support your _reasons_ or as the basis of _acknowledgement and response_.

## Method
* Method sources provide governing concepts and technical vocabulary.
* A method source may inform the structure of your _reasons_ or how you select _evidence_.

## In sum:
"Writers _rely_ on background sources, _interpret_ or _analyze_ exhibits, _engage_ arguments, and _follow_ methods." (Bizup, 76) 


## Example
* Salih, Sara. “The History of Mary Prince,the Black Subject, and the Black Canon” in _Discourses of Slavery and Abolition: Britain and its Colonies, 1760-1838_, eds.Carey, et al. (2004)

## Claim
"I will argue that to install 'Mary Prince' and _The History of Mary Prince_ as inaugural and canonical overlooks instability of the former along with the striking intra- and inter-textuality of the latter." (Salih, 123-24)

* This claim is contextualized by using Olney (1985) as a BACKGROUND source (Salih, 123).

## Reason 1
"Mary Prince" is not a stable author with a single identity.

* Pouchet Paquet (1992) and Ferguson (1992) used as ARGUMENT sources to disagree with (Salih, 128).
* Different editions of _The History_ used as EXHIBIT to destabilize the notion of a single author (Salih, 130).

## Reason 2
_The History_ is best understood as a series of intra-textual documents with multiple authors (Salih, 132)

* Citation of Joseph Phillip's letter within _The History_ used as EXHIBIT to show that _The History_ has more than one author (Salih, 131).

## Warrant
"... why, for example, include the text in a canon of 'black women's writing' if at least half of it is not written by a black woman..." (Salih, 134).
